# DeFi Explained

This guide aims to quickly onboard you into Decentralized Finance (DeFi) without delving into technical details.

In traditional, centralized finance, service providers act as intermediaries between the user and the service. Access and participation in these services are conditional and regulated by the service provider.

- Banks impose minimum account balances, withdrawal caps, and transfer limits on savings accounts.
- Credit card issuers can cancel your card and service if they detect any activity they deem suspicious.
- Investment opportunities are often restricted, excluding all but the wealthiest individuals.

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) offers financial services without centralized control.

> In DeFi, services operate autonomously, are generally unregulated, and do not require human administration.

Technologies like the internet, cryptography, and blockchain enable the creation of financial instruments where trust and reliability are guaranteed by computer programs, eliminating the need for human intermediaries.

> DeFi is an ecosystem, and even a movement, aimed at creating a financial system open to everyone and minimizing reliance on central authorities.

Most DeFi services currently operate on the Ethereum blockchain in the form of decentralized apps (DApps). While Ethereum is the most popular platform for DeFi services, it is not the only one. This guide focuses on DeFi services on Ethereum.

It is recommended to review the [Ethereum guide](../../token_guides/en/ethereum.md) to understand Ethereum, Smart Contracts, and DApps, which are essential for comprehending DeFi.

## DeFi Attributes

DeFi services are typically built around the following principles:

- **Open To All**: Anyone with an internet connection and cryptocurrency can use a service, regardless of location, age, experience, social status, etc.

- **Censorship Resistant**: DeFi services operate on a distributed blockchain powered by thousands of servers, ensuring uninterrupted access to anyone worldwide.

- **Non-Custodial**: Users always maintain full control over their assets, without reliance on an external custodian.

- **Enforce Trust**: DeFi services are transparent with open code, ensuring they cannot operate outside the pre-programmed rules, preventing cheating, theft, or misuse of funds.

- **Independent**: DeFi services generally do not belong to any single entity and may be moderated by a distributed group of anonymous entities.

The goal of DeFi is to reconstruct financial instruments globally by building open, censorship-resistant, decentralized alternatives.

> A DeFi service must ensure unconditional access and full user control over assets. If a service can freeze funds or censor users, it cannot be classified as DeFi.

## DeFi History

Bitcoin and Ethereum are foundational DeFi systems, controlled by large networks of distributed computers rather than central authorities.

1. [Bitcoin](../../token_guides/en/bitcoin.md) was the first blockchain, enabling transactions without third-party execution. It now handles [300K transactions a day](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactions.html#1y).

2. [Ethereum](../../token_guides/en/ethereum.md) introduced conditional transactions, allowing complex financial services that are always online, censorship-resistant, and autonomous.

3. Over the years, Ethereum has attracted engineers and entrepreneurs to build new DeFi services, producing significant DeFi platforms handling substantial sums despite some deficiencies.

> Entrepreneurs and engineers are recreating traditional financial instruments in a decentralized architecture, outside company and government control.

## DeFi Today

DeFi has attracted many well-financed startups, entrepreneurs, and finance professionals. As of November 2021, the total value controlled by top DeFi projects exceeded 100 billion USD.

DeFi projects are expected to have open source code, speeding up ecosystem development by allowing engineers to reuse components from other projects.

DeFi projects generally raise funds through token sales via ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings) or similar processes, selling tokens that represent governance weight or profit share in the project.

Most DeFi projects take the form of a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) and are governed by a distributed group of entities, often through proposals and voting mechanisms.
