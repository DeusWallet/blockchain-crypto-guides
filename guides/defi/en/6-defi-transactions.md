# DeFi Transactions

Transacting on DeFi platforms involves unique considerations and complexities. Here are some key points to understand:

- **Step Complexity**: DeFi transactions can involve numerous steps with conditional logic.
- **Higher Processing Fees**: More complex transactions often incur higher fees.
- **Privacy**: DeFi transactions are as private as the Ethereum blockchain they are built on.

## Transaction Complexity

DeFi transactions can be extremely complex, often referred to as programmable money. Here is an example of a complex transaction involving multiple steps:

1. Take an ETH flash loan.
2. Send the borrowed ETH to DEX1.
3. Convert ETH to USDT on DEX1.
4. Send USDT to DEX2.
5. Convert USDT to USDC on DEX2.
6. Send USDC to DEX3.
7. Convert USDC to ETH on DEX3.
8. Return the ETH loan (keeping any profits).

DeFi smart contracts are interoperable, allowing multiple DeFi services to be connected programmatically, similar to building with Lego blocks. While such transactions are currently limited to those with a deep understanding of the ecosystem and some programming skills, anyone can start experimenting with personal cryptocurrency or flash loans.

For a real-life example, check out [this post](https://www.coindesk.com/first-mover-how-a-defi-trader-made-an-89-profit-in-minutes-slinging-stablecoins) detailing a transaction where someone made approximately $40,000 in minutes using multiple DeFi services.

## Transaction Fees

Simple Ethereum transactions, such as sending Ethereum or tokens from one address to another, are generally less expensive than complex DeFi transactions, which involve higher processing fees.

> Ethereum DeFi transactions are typically more complex and thus require higher processing fees than standard token transfers.

This high fee issue might be mitigated as the Ethereum blockchain expands its capacity or as DeFi services migrate to faster blockchains like Solana, Avalanche, or Algorand. Until then, DeFi transaction costs are likely to continue increasing, especially as the ecosystem attracts more users.

## DeFi Service Fees

Most DeFi services charge small fees, although some may not. For example, decentralized exchanges (DEXes) charge traders a small service fee for each trade. Consequently, traders typically pay:

- A service fee (e.g., 0.02% - 0.04%) to the DEX smart contract.
- A transaction fee to the Ethereum network nodes.

Similarly, lending services like Aave or Compound charge fees for lending cryptocurrency, in addition to blockchain transaction fees.

## Approval Transactions

An important aspect of DeFi transactions is approval transactions. When interacting with a smart contract, users often need to grant the contract permission to access their funds.

> Granting permission involves an 'approval transaction,' which doesn't transfer funds but allows the smart contract to spend a specified amount of the user's tokens.

Most DeFi services require an approval transaction before users can utilize the service.

## DeFi Privacy

Since most DeFi projects are built on the Ethereum blockchain, DeFi privacy is tied to Ethereum's privacy model. All DeFi transactions expose your Ethereum address, allowing anyone to view the entire transaction history and token balances associated with that address. While this doesnâ€™t directly link to your identity, it does reveal your activity on the blockchain.

To enhance privacy, consider using multiple Ethereum wallets:

- **Asset Storage Wallet**: Use this wallet for securely storing Ethereum tokens and assets. Avoid using it for transactions with other entities to keep your balances private.
- **Generic Payments Wallet**: Set up a separate wallet for everyday transactions.
- **DeFi Transactions Wallet**: Consider creating another wallet specifically for DeFi transactions. Like the storage wallet, avoid using this for transactions with known entities to maintain privacy.
