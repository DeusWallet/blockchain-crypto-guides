# Decentralized Exchanges

Nearly all major [cryptocurrency exchanges](../../fundamentals/en/6-buying-cryptocurrency-basics.md) today are centralized. These exchanges offer an easy way to trade cryptocurrency for fiat money like USD or EUR.

However, due to their centralized nature, access to these exchanges is limited and highly regulated. Users on centralized exchanges face significant privacy and security risks as these platforms are often targeted by hackers.

> The emergence of decentralized exchanges (DEXes) has opened access to cryptocurrency markets for anyone worldwide, providing substantially better security and privacy.

When trading on a DEX, the exchange occurs without relying on an intermediary between the buyer and seller.

- Trades are controlled by smart contracts residing on a blockchain (e.g., Ethereum) that cannot do anything outside their programmed functions.
- Anyone with cryptocurrency can trade on a decentralized exchange without needing to go through identity checks and other procedures.
- Decentralized exchanges typically operate only with cryptocurrency and do not facilitate the use of fiat currency.

Today, there are decentralized exchanges with an average 24-hour trading volume exceeding $100 million USD. More DEX-related stats can be found on [DuneAnalytics.com](https://explore.duneanalytics.com/public/dashboards/c87JEtVi2GlyIZHQOR02NsfyJV48eaKEQSiKplJ7).

As of November 2021, the most popular decentralized exchanges for trading cryptocurrencies are:

- [Uniswap](https://uniswap.info/home)
- [Curve](https://curve.fi)

Instruments like [1inch.exchange](https://1inch.exchange/) provide the best exchange prices by splitting a trade order among multiple DEXes in a single transaction.

> When using a DEX, always access the officially advertised website for the DEX.

There are many fake websites that mimic legitimate DEXes. Additionally, numerous fake coins have been listed on DEXes where token listing is open to all.

## Liquidity Pools

The first generation of decentralized exchanges struggled to attract cryptocurrency traders due to low trading volumes for most trading pairs. As a result, most people used centralized exchanges, which typically have higher trading volumes.

> Liquidity pools emerged as a solution to increase liquidity on decentralized exchanges.

Liquidity pools are fully autonomous, human-independent smart contracts that:

1. Allow cryptocurrency owners to deposit assets into a smart contract and earn passive income without losing access to their funds.
2. Use the accumulated funds to provide instant liquidity to buyers and sellers on a DEX for a small fee that goes to the depositors.
3. Provide liquidity pool tokens (LP tokens) to depositors, representing partial ownership of assets in the pool, including a share of the accumulated trading fees.

Liquidity pools have no listing fees or barriers; anyone can add assets to an existing pool or create a new one. Depositors can withdraw their assets along with earnings from the pool at any time.

In summary, each trading pair on a DEX is powered by a community-funded liquidity pool smart contract. Anyone can join the pool by depositing the accepted cryptocurrency assets.

Most major DEXes use liquidity pools to provide liquidity for token trades. Below, let's look at some of the most popular DEXes operating on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Uniswap Exchange

Uniswap is the largest and one of the most decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges. Exchange operators cannot censor users or shut down the service.

The exchange lists numerous cryptocurrency tokens and has a free listing policy, allowing anyone to list a token and provide liquidity for it.

For traders, it costs 0.03% of the traded amount to execute a transaction on Uniswap.
