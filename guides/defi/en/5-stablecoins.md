# Stablecoins

Stablecoins were among the first decentralized financial instruments to emerge from the DeFi ecosystem. 

A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to peg its market value to an external asset, such as USD, EUR, gold, or another cryptocurrency.

> DeFi smart contracts have enabled the creation of cryptocurrencies with fixed values, such as 1 USD or 1 ounce of gold. These stablecoins employ various mechanisms to maintain their value close to the peg.

Stablecoins avoid the price volatility typical of other cryptocurrencies, making them a preferred medium of exchange in many DeFi services.

Each stablecoin has unique characteristics:

- The [DAI](../../token_guides/en/makerdao.md) stablecoin is decentralized and governed entirely by smart contracts without privileged parties. It adheres closely to DeFi principles and operates autonomously.

- Tether's [USDT](../../token_guides/en/tether.md) is also built on Ethereum but is centralized, allowing certain parties (e.g., Tether Limited) to issue new tokens and freeze tokens as needed.

Although many stablecoins are built on Ethereum, not all adhere to DeFi principles.

## 1. DAI (~ USD)

The most decentralized stablecoin on the Ethereum network, DAI is a service provided by MakerDAO.

## 4. BUSD (~ USD)

BUSD is a US dollar-backed stablecoin from Binance and Paxos, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange. Like USDT and USDC, it is centralized.

## 5. PAX (~ USD)

PAX is another centralized stablecoin, claimed to be backed 1:1 with the US dollar. PAX tokens are issued by the Paxos Trust Company.

## 6. sUSD / sBTC

sUSD and sBTC are decentralized stablecoins pegged to USD and BTC, respectively. Created on the Synthetix platform, they are backed by collateral up to 800% of the asset value.

## 7. renBTC (~ BTC)

renBTC represents Bitcoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Each renBTC token is backed 1:1 by Bitcoin, redeemable for BTC on the Bitcoin network.

## 8. wBTC (~ BTC)

Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) is an Ethereum-based token backed 1:1 with Bitcoin. Custodians create and destroy WBTC tokens in response to BTC deposits and withdrawals, ensuring transparency.

A single WBTC token corresponds to 1 Bitcoin, and anyone can exchange WBTC for BTC through a custodian. Custodian activities are transparent, allowing verification of WBTC creation, burning, and BTC reserves.
