# How To DeFi

To start engaging with most DeFi services, you only need an internet connection and some cryptocurrency.

> DeFi services are open to all, with no age, experience, geographical, or other conditions.

Let's cover the tools and know-how needed to get you started practically.

- A single DeFi service can have multiple websites or apps. Since smart contracts reside on an always-online blockchain, anyone can build a graphical interface to them in the form of a website or mobile app.

- DeFi services require users to connect using a [non-custodial](../../fundamentals/en/2-wallets-basics.md) cryptocurrency wallet like Deus. This wallet is your means to authenticate and connect to the smart contract.

## Getting Started

Connecting to a DeFi service requires a non-custodial wallet with "WalletConnect" capability. Most well-engineered non-custodial wallets (like Deus, Trust, or MEW) support this feature.

1. Open your web browser and navigate to the DeFi service website you want to use.
2. Look for the 'connect wallet' button or a similar option. Click on it and select the "WalletConnect" option.
3. A popup window with a QR code should appear.
4. Open your wallet app and locate the "WalletConnect" feature. In Deus, this option is in the Settings tab.
5. Click on the "WalletConnect" feature in your wallet app to open the QR code scanner. Scan the QR code presented in step 3.
6. Click on the Connect button.

## DeFi Risks

Most DeFi services operate non-custodially, meaning users interact directly with the smart contracts that control the service.

> Users always remain in control of their funds and can withdraw them at any time.

However, DeFi also carries risks:

- If something goes wrong with the smart contract powering a DeFi service, there's no insurance protecting users' assets.
- Many DeFi products are still considered experimental, despite handling large sums of cryptocurrency.
- Entities launching DeFi projects often retain a significant portion of tokens and may sell them during periods of hype when prices are high.

Therefore, in DeFi, you bear full responsibility if something goes wrong. There's no entity to complain to or hold liable.

> DeFi is 'trustless' because it doesn't require a third party to manage your funds. However, you must trust the code and the competence of those who built it.

While some major DeFi services undergo third-party security audits, not all can afford this. Hence, risk is present in all DeFi products. Always keep this in mind and never invest more than you are willing to lose.
