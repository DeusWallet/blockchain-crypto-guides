# Buying Cryptocurrency

By now, you should have a solid understanding of the basics of dealing with cryptocurrencies and wallets. In this section, we’ll explore various ways of acquiring cryptocurrency.

## 1. Buying Crypto with a Credit Card

The easiest option for buying smaller amounts of cryptocurrency is using a credit or debit card. While convenient, this option often comes with a slight premium. Here are some safe websites and services to purchase cryptocurrency using a credit or debit card:

1. [Binance.com](https://www.binance.com/en/register?ref=42579924)
2. [Coinbase.com](https://coinbase.com)

These websites work well for residents of the EU and the US, but those in other regions may find fewer opportunities.

## 2. Buying Crypto on an Exchange

For those planning to acquire larger amounts of cryptocurrency, signing up for and using a cryptocurrency exchange is recommended. Exchanges typically offer more competitive prices than direct credit card purchases and list hundreds of different cryptocurrencies that can be traded for fiat currency like USD or other cryptocurrencies. Trading on an exchange might seem confusing at first, but it becomes easier with practice.

Cryptocurrency exchanges must adhere to local currency dealing laws, which vary by country, meaning not all exchanges are available worldwide. Most exchanges implement Know Your Customer ([KYC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer)) and Anti-Money Laundering ([AML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering#Combating)) checks before allowing cryptocurrency purchases. These regulations help prevent the handling of stolen fiat currency or engagement in identity fraud.

The process for purchasing cryptocurrency on an exchange typically involves:

1. Creating an account on the exchange
2. Verifying your identity
3. Transferring funds to your account
4. Purchasing cryptocurrency
5. Withdrawing cryptocurrency to a wallet

The amount a user can purchase usually depends on their level of verification. For example, verifying your email might allow you to purchase $500-$1000 worth of Bitcoin, while providing additional documents can increase this limit. Many exchanges use a tiered approach to user verification.

Here are some trusted cryptocurrency exchanges:

* [Binance.com](https://www.binance.com/en/register?ref=42579924)
* [Coinbase.com](https://coinbase.com)
* [Kraken.com](https://kraken.com)

For large purchases, stablecoin issuers like [Tether](https://tether.to) and [Circle](https://www.circle.com/en/usdc) offer options to buy large amounts of cryptocurrency stablecoins for fiat via bank deposit.

## 3. Getting Paid in Crypto

It’s increasingly common for online freelancers to accept cryptocurrencies as payment. If you provide online services or have an online store, consider accepting payments in cryptocurrencies. Options include services like [BitPay.com](https://bitpay.com) or [Coinbase Commerce](https://commerce.coinbase.com), as well as free DIY solutions like [BTCPayServer](https://btcpayserver.org) for those with technical skills.

## 4. Buying Crypto on a P2P Platform

If you know someone willing to sell you some crypto, buying with cash is a good option. Most people acquire their first cryptocurrency from someone they know. To do this, you need a non-custodial wallet. Simply open the app, copy the 'receive' address for the cryptocurrency you plan on receiving, send it to the sender, and wait for the cryptocurrency to appear in your wallet.

There are also P2P platforms like [LocalBitcoins.com](https://localbitcoins.com) and [Bisq](https://bisq.network) that connect buyers and sellers from different regions, allowing them to exchange assets via various methods. These platforms are useful in regions where access to the above-mentioned cryptocurrency exchanges is limited. However, be cautious and proceed carefully when transacting large sums, as there are risks involved, including the possibility of dealing with scammers.

## 5. Buying Crypto on a DEX

Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are a relatively new phenomenon. Like cryptocurrencies, DEXs use blockchain technology to provide a platform for direct cryptocurrency exchanges. DEXs are generally the most secure and private way to purchase cryptocurrency. Most currently support only Ethereum and Ethereum-based tokens.

DEXs connect buyers and sellers in a peer-to-peer manner according to a pre-programmed protocol, ensuring a cheat-proof environment.

Decentralized Exchanges:

- [1inch](https://app.1inch.io/)
- [SushiSwap](https://app.sushi.com/swap)

Note that most DEXs support trading only Ethereum-based assets and do not handle fiat currencies (e.g., USD, EUR). They usually don’t require account verification and impose no limits on the amount that can be bought or sold. However, participating in DEXs can be challenging for beginners.
