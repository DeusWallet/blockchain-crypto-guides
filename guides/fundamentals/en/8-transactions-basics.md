# Transactions Explained

Understanding cryptocurrency transactions is essential for navigating the world of digital currencies. While the process of sending and receiving payments is similar across different cryptocurrencies, some aspects can vary. This section will cover the essentials of cryptocurrency transactions, applicable to almost all cryptocurrencies.

## Sending and Receiving Crypto

The process of sending and receiving cryptocurrency is straightforward and similar across most wallet apps.

### Sending Crypto

1. **Open Your Wallet App**: Find the option to "send" or its equivalent.
2. **Select the Correct Cryptocurrency**: If your wallet supports multiple currencies, ensure you select the right one.
3. **Enter Details**: Input the recipient's address, the amount to send, and the transaction fee.
4. **Send**: Confirm and send the transaction.

### Receiving Crypto

1. **Open Your Wallet App**: Find the option to "receive" or its equivalent.
2. **Select the Correct Cryptocurrency**: Ensure you're copying the address for the correct coin.
3. **Share Address**: Share the receive address with the sender and wait for the cryptocurrency to appear in your wallet.

## Transaction Phases

Cryptocurrency transactions are not instant and can take from a few seconds to several hours, depending on the cryptocurrency.

### 1. Transaction Is Pending

Once sent, the transaction reaches the blockchain network almost immediately. Both sender and recipient can monitor the transaction status via their wallet apps or on a public blockchain explorer like [Blockchair.com](https://blockchair.com).

### 2. Transaction Gets Confirmed

Nodes on the blockchain validate and include the transaction in a block. The time for this step varies by blockchain; for example, Bitcoin takes about 10 minutes, while Ethereum takes around 2-3 minutes. High network activity can cause delays.

### 3. Transaction Is Final

After being added to the blockchain, the transaction is considered final. For high-value transactions, it's recommended to wait for several additional blocks to pass (e.g., six blocks for Bitcoin) for added security. For most transactions, 1-2 confirmations are sufficient.

## Transaction Fees

Sending cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum involves paying a transaction fee, which compensates the node that first adds the transaction to the blockchain.

- **Fee Variation**: Fees vary by cryptocurrency and can range from a fraction of a cent to over $1.
- **Network Congestion**: During high network activity, higher fees can prioritize your transaction.

Some wallets, like Deus, recommend optimal transaction fees based on current network conditions. For large or time-sensitive transactions, consider providing a fee above the average to ensure timely processing.

## Cancelling Transactions

In certain cases, you can cancel or modify a transaction while it's still pending. However, this depends on the wallet app and the specific cryptocurrency. Once a transaction is added to the blockchain, it generally cannot be reversed.

## Transaction Privacy

Most blockchain transactions are stored openly, revealing details such as transaction amounts and addresses but not the identities of the parties involved. Privacy varies between cryptocurrencies.

### Bitcoin Privacy

Bitcoin wallets can generate multiple addresses for receiving payments, enhancing privacy. Using a new address for each transaction helps prevent others from tracking your transaction history and balance.

### Ethereum Privacy

Ethereum wallets typically use a single address for receiving payments, making it easier to trace transaction history and balances. For better privacy, use separate wallets for transactions and for holding funds.

### Privacy Recommendations

- **Bitcoin**: Use a new receive address for each transaction.
- **Ethereum**: Use separate wallets for transactions and for storing large amounts.

To summarize, Bitcoin transactions generally offer more privacy than Ethereum transactions, although neither can completely hide transaction details from the public.

By understanding these transaction mechanics and privacy considerations, you can better manage and protect your cryptocurrency assets.
