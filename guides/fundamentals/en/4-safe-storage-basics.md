# Safe Storage

Let's explore different types of non-custodial wallets.

First, there's no universally suitable wallet. The ideal non-custodial wallet depends on factors such as:

* Familiarity with security aspects
* Amount of cryptocurrency to store
* Frequency of wallet access
* Likelihood of being a target
* Location of the user

Some wallets are more user-friendly and suitable for beginners with smaller balances. Conversely, individuals with substantial crypto holdings and extensive security knowledge will have higher expectations and may prefer wallets designed for enhanced security.

This section will provide an overview of common non-custodial wallets, focusing on their security aspects. A balanced approach involves a tiered strategy, where higher security measures are introduced as the risk increases.

An ideal wallet for a newcomer with less than $10,000 in crypto differs significantly from one for a seasoned user with over $100,000.

As crypto holdings grow, so does the potential cost of loss. In such cases, it's wise to divide the holdings among multiple wallets, keeping a larger portion in highly secure storage and the remainder in more accessible but less secure wallets.

## Non-Custodial Wallet Types

All non-custodial wallets provide users with full control over their crypto, a key characteristic of such wallets. There are three main types:

1. Hardware wallets
2. Mobile app wallets
3. Desktop software wallets

Non-custodial wallets vary in how well they protect private keys. Some are designed with even the most unlikely scenarios in mind.

For instance, securing a private key on an iOS or Android wallet on a well-maintained phone is generally easier than on a desktop wallet running on a general-purpose Windows computer.

### 1. Hardware Wallets

Hardware wallets are typically small devices resembling USB drives, engineered solely for securely storing large amounts of cryptocurrency.

These devices are widely considered the most secure, designed to make physical extraction of private keys impossible, even if an attacker gains physical possession of the wallet.

From a usability perspective, hardware wallets are somewhat more complex. They're manageable for those familiar with cryptocurrencies but may be challenging for newcomers.

For individuals with substantial crypto assets, using a hardware wallet is advisable. At the very least, they should explore these wallets with the intent to move a portion of their assets to a hardware wallet in the future.

Two well-known hardware wallet providers are:

- [Trezor](https://trezor.io)
- [Ledger Wallet](https://www.ledgerwallet.com)

It's important to buy these directly from the provider's website.

### 2. Mobile Wallets

Mobile wallets for iOS and Android are the most common type of non-custodial wallet apps. These wallets are generally more user-friendly. Our very own [Deus Wallet](https://deuswallet.com) is one such wallet.

From a security standpoint, hardware wallets are more secure than mobile wallets.

Mobile wallets operate on all-purpose operating systems (iOS, Android) with many software and hardware components, potentially opening up more attack surfaces.

Both Google's Android and Apple's iOS have a 'secure element' for handling highly sensitive data. Well-engineered wallets utilize this to keep the private key inaccessible even if the phone is compromised.

### 3. Desktop Wallets

Desktop wallets are theoretically less secure than mobile wallets for the same reasons mobile wallets are less secure than hardware wallets. The attack surface on a desktop operating system is larger due to the nature of the platform.

This doesn't mean some desktop wallets are less secure than certain mobile wallets.

Some popular desktop wallets are:

- [Electrum](https://electrum.org)
- [Exodus](https://www.exodus.io)

## So, Which Wallet?

While private key security is crucial, it's not the only factor when choosing a wallet. Other factors, such as privacy and essential features, should also be considered.

For instance, a non-custodial mobile wallet app might offer better privacy than a hardware wallet.

> **A hardware wallet may offer superior security but unintentionally expose customers' personal data. A [recent breach](https://decrypt.co/37063/bitcoin-wallet-ledgers-database-hacked-for-1-million-emails) of a company selling Ledger hardware wallets exemplifies this.**

You don't need cartel-level security if you're just starting out. The out-of-the-box security on most well-known non-custodial wallet apps is already quite good.

> **A balanced approach is tiered, introducing higher security measures as the risk factor grows.**

The minimum security requirements for using any non-custodial wallet app should be:

- **Security Basics**

    The device owner should understand digital security fundamentals. For mobile wallets, the OS should be free of unauthorized applications and kept up to date.
 
- **Standard Compliant**

    The wallet should generate private keys per publicly documented security standards, allowing seamless migration to third-party wallets if needed.

- **Unauthorized Access**
    
    The wallet device should be protected with a PIN or similar mechanism. Without a PIN, a thief could easily access your cryptocurrency accounts.

## Multiple Wallets

For smaller crypto amounts (e.g., less than $10,000), standard security measures suffice. As holdings grow, introduce additional security measures like splitting the capital into multiple wallets.

For example, start with a single wallet for an initial crypto capital of $10,000. As the capital grows, adopt a tiered approach:

- **Generic Wallet**

    A mobile or desktop non-custodial wallet for smaller amounts and everyday transactions.
    
- **Investment Wallet**

    A mobile non-custodial wallet for active investments, allowing easy and frequent access to funds.
    
- **Cold Storage Wallet**

    A hardware wallet for long-term storage without the need for regular access.

Newcomers to cryptocurrency will likely find mobile-based wallets easier to use.

Keeping your mobile wallet on your phone is convenient. Your cryptocurrency is close, easy to access, and can be used for investments and payments on the go.

Those holding large amounts in cryptocurrency should adopt a tiered approach from the start.

> **The basic principle is to keep a larger portion of dormant holdings in a hardware wallet not meant for frequent access.**

If the sum stored in the hardware wallet is substantial, consider splitting it between two or more hardware wallets.

## Wallet Backup Tips

Having a backup of a private key for each wallet is crucial.

Some prefer to write the private key (presented as words) on paper and store it securely. Others write the words in a file and store an encrypted copy online.

> **It's not advisable to have a digital version of the private key (even if encrypted) for a wallet with a large amount of crypto.**
> 
> **For smaller amounts, this should not be a significant issue if you understand the risks.** 

### Tip 1: Optional Password

Some wallet apps allow users to add an optional password along with the 12/24 words when setting up a new wallet.

This additional security measure keeps the words separate from the password, enhancing security.

> **This ensures that even if someone finds the list of words, the password is still needed to access the funds.**

The password can be memorized or written down and stored separately from the words.

However, adding a password can limit future migration options, as not all non-custodial wallets support passwords.

For hardware wallets holding large sums, it's recommended to set up the private key with 12/24 words plus a password. All hardware wallets should support this option.

### Tip 2: Offline Backups

When storing private keys (or hardware wallets) offline, consider the following:

- Keep the private key backup separate from the wallet device.
- Store the private key words and password separately.
- Protect the private key backup or wallet device from being found by others.
- Ensure the hardware wallet is protected by a PIN.
- Take precautions against fire or floods.

A backup of words can be stored in a metal container from [Crypto Steel](http://cryptosteel.com). The password can be memorized or stored physically in a separate location.

This results in:

1. A hardware wallet device protected by a PIN.
2. A private key (useless without the password)
3. A password (useless without the words)

Storing all three items separately achieves a good level of crypto security. To access your funds, you'll need either the wallet device and PIN or the private key and password.

Share enough information with trusted individuals so they can recover access to funds if you become unreachable.

## Conclusion

By now, you should have a solid understanding of non-custodial wallets and their importance in securely storing cryptocurrencies. 

Non-custodial wallets guarantee ownership of your crypto, unlike custodial wallets provided by exchanges, which can censor or block access to your funds.

For those holding large amounts of crypto, consider splitting funds into multiple wallets, with a significant portion in a hardware wallet.
