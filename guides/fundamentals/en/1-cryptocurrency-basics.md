# Cryptocurrency

This guide aims to help newcomers quickly gain a comfortable understanding of cryptocurrencies.

Cryptocurrencies are primarily powered by blockchain technology.

> **Blockchain technology was first used to create Bitcoin.**
>
> **It established an open platform for value exchange, ensuring that actions outside agreed rules are impossible.**

When using a blockchain-based product, the following statements hold true:

- Users don’t have to trust anyone.
- No permission is needed to participate.
- Users have unconditional control over their assets.
- Blockchain records are immutable.

Blockchain technology has potential applications in areas where trust, censorship-resistance, and immutability are essential, such as notary services and elections.

Currently, many financial and legal agencies enforce rules that could be more impartially enforced by blockchain. As blockchain technology grows, these services may transition to blockchain.

> **The first generation of blockchain-based products, like Bitcoin, aim to create a financial platform for value exchange without intermediaries like banks.**

Bitcoin was the first product to use blockchain to challenge areas controlled by the financial system.

## Blockchain Attributes

So, what is a blockchain? While many definitions can sound complex, it’s actually quite simple.

> **Think of a blockchain as a chronological history of records.**
>
> **These records could be transactions, votes, or any other data.**

When this history of records is put on a blockchain, it gains attributes that make it socially valuable:

- **Distributed Nature**

    Instead of being held in one centralized location, the blockchain's records are stored in thousands of locations simultaneously, updating in near real-time.

- **Peer-to-peer Transmission**

    Anyone can add new records to the global history by communicating with any entity that keeps the records. This ensures 24/7 availability and unconditional access.

- **Transparency & Pseudonymity**

    Blockchains are generally transparent, with the entire history of records public and accessible. While the records are public, the entities involved are masked: third parties can see the actions but not the identities.

- **Irreversibility Of Records**

    Blockchain design ensures that once an action takes place, it cannot be changed, preventing tampering with the history of records.

- **Business Logic**

    Modern blockchains allow adding conditional logic to records. Instead of a simple 'A paid B x bitcoins,' it can include conditions like 'A paid B x bitcoins, but B can’t spend them for 10 years.'

Blockchains thus offer more than just a history of records; they enable new ways for society to organize and exchange value without needing intermediaries.

## Blockchains Are Free

Blockchains typically have open-source code, making it possible for anyone to reuse it. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains are open source.

Thousands of engineers worldwide work on improving these blockchains. Major blockchain projects are driven by a large group of independent engineers, making it impossible for any single party to shut down, compromise, or censor networks like Bitcoin or Ethereum.

## Cryptocurrencies Explained

Cryptocurrencies are units of something on a blockchain. Depending on the underlying blockchain, one cryptocurrency can differ significantly from another.

**For instance:**

- Bitcoin is the native unit of measurement on the [Bitcoin](../../token_guides/en/bitcoin.md) blockchain, symbolized by 'BTC'. A single Bitcoin is divisible into 100 million sub-units called Satoshis. The Bitcoin blockchain caps the total amount at 21 million Bitcoins, and it primarily stores transaction records.

- Ether is the native unit on the [Ethereum](../../token_guides/en/ethereum.md) blockchain, symbolized by 'ETH'. A single Ether consists of 100,000,000,000,000,000 wei. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum does not cap the total amount of Ether and can store various types of records.

Some blockchains, like Ethereum, enable creating custom 'units of something' for different purposes. These are often called cryptocurrency tokens and make up 80-90% of all [cryptocurrencies](https://coinmarketcap.com). The Ethereum blockchain is a preferred platform for creating these tokens.

Technically, 'token' refers to cryptocurrencies built on top of an existing blockchain, rather than having their own. Cryptocurrency tokens can serve many purposes, depending on their use cases.

## How Cryptocurrencies Grow

Many people wonder why there are so many cryptocurrencies and why some are more popular or valuable than others.

While some cryptocurrencies are unique in their underlying blockchain, many are copies. Since blockchains have open code, anyone can launch a duplicate cryptocurrency. These duplicates are not substantially different from the original except in network size.

> **The size of the underlying network makes one cryptocurrency more valuable than another.**

Network size can be thought of as the number of people interacting with a blockchain. 

1. The more participants, the bigger the network.
2. As the network grows, so does the blockchain's security and decentralization.
3. More participants make the blockchain an open platform for services.

Bitcoin is a good example. Launched in 2009, what started as a novelty for a small group has attracted millions. 

> **Thousands of people now run Bitcoin blockchain servers, keeping a live copy of the blockchain and acting as keepers and validators.**
>
> **Even more people use Bitcoin or build services around its ecosystem.**

Bitcoin has become a global, censorship-resistant platform open to all. Its open and permissionless nature means anyone can participate, either as a user or a service provider. 

> **The bigger the blockchain network, the more attractive it is to service providers.**

Thus, along with blockchain attributes, network size is key to evaluating a blockchain. The most valuable cryptocurrency usually has the biggest network, not necessarily the most features.
