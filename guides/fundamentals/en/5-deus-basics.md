This section will focus on practical aspects and 'things to know' when using non-custodial wallet apps.

From a user's perspective, basic expectations from any non-custodial wallet app should be:

1. **Standard-Compliant Key Generation**: The wallet app should generate private keys in a standard-compliant manner, ensuring their safety and compatibility with other third-party wallet apps.

2. **Correct Management of Multiple Cryptocurrencies**: The wallet app should correctly manage payment addresses for each cryptocurrency, ensuring, for example, that the user's Bitcoin address is different from their Ethereum address.

3. **Secure Private Key Storage**: The wallet app should store private keys following documented guidelines. Both iOS and Android wallet apps should utilize the safe storage mechanisms provided by their operating systems to keep private keys secure.

Additional expectations may vary based on the target user. For example, someone seeking extensive privacy may require features not available in most wallet apps.

Below, we will highlight some important points to keep in mind when using non-custodial wallet apps, using the Deus wallet app to illustrate these aspects.

### 1. Setup / Restore

Every non-custodial wallet starts with either setting up a new wallet or migrating an existing one.

- The **'Create Wallet'** button generates a new private key and displays it as 12 words, which need to be backed up.
- The **'Restore Wallet'** option restores an existing wallet that was created earlier in Deus or another standard-compliant wallet.

Restoring a non-custodial wallet can take anywhere from a few minutes to a couple of hours.

### 2. Authorization Lock

Non-custodial wallet apps should include built-in measures to prevent unauthorized access. Both mobile and hardware wallets implement this through an unlock code required to access the wallet.

This measure is essential to keep your funds safe even if someone gains physical access to your wallet device.

### 3. Supported Cryptocurrencies

The more cryptocurrencies a wallet can handle, the better. Itâ€™s convenient to manage multiple cryptocurrencies within a single app rather than switching between multiple apps.

The wallet app should also display current cryptocurrency prices, showing your balances in familiar currencies like USD or EUR. This is particularly helpful for making payments, as it simplifies calculations.

### 4. Coin Overviews

Each cryptocurrency is a unique project with its own specifics. Understanding these specifics is crucial for anyone looking to invest in cryptocurrencies.

Many projects remain obscure, even to those with a technical background. Deus aims to provide a comprehensive overview of various cryptocurrencies in simple terms.

### 5. Charts & Data

Choose a wallet that displays historical market exchange rates for tokens.

Historical prices provide an overview of how a cryptocurrency's price has changed and allow users to see historical exchange rates on past transactions.

### 6. Multi Wallet

Some wallets, including Deus, allow the creation of unlimited wallets within a single app.

This feature enables users to manage multiple cryptocurrency portfolios easily.

### 7. Privacy

Privacy features in non-custodial wallets can vary significantly.

Consider the following points when evaluating a wallet for privacy features:

- **Basic User Data**: Depending on the wallet's design, the provider may know some non-identifiable data like the user's IP address and location. If this data is stored on a server, there is always a risk of a data breach.
    
- **Balance and Transactions**: Some wallets allow users to restore or migrate an existing wallet. Wallet providers may use a special server optimized for this task, which can potentially expose information about the user's balance and past transactions.

    To address this, wallets like Deus support restoring directly from the blockchain network itself, ensuring the provider has no information about the user's balance or transactions.
    
- **Blockchain Privacy**: Different blockchains offer varying levels of privacy. Bitcoin transactions are generally more private than Ethereum transactions. Some non-custodial wallets include features that enhance privacy on specific blockchains. For example, Deus integrates features to make linking Bitcoin transactions to a single entity significantly more difficult.

The minimum privacy requirement for a user should be a wallet that knows absolutely nothing about its users.

### 8. Censorship-Resistance

Given the evolving legal landscape for cryptocurrencies, look for a wallet app designed to be:

- Resistant to censorship
- Functional in all regions
- Always accessible for transactions

A genuine non-custodial wallet should work everywhere and always be accessible for transactions. If a non-custodial wallet is blocked in your region, you should be able to migrate your private key to another non-custodial wallet app.
