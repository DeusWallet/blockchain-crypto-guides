# Wallets Explained

Cryptocurrencies offer capabilities that are not available with traditional financial instruments. It's crucial to understand these capabilities, especially for those looking to safely store and accumulate cryptocurrencies.

- **Traditional Financial Instruments:** With deposits in a bank or stocks with a broker, an intermediary keeps and controls the assets. Your access depends on this entity.
  
- **Cryptocurrencies:** Users can have exclusive control over their funds without intermediaries. This allows individuals to act as their own custodians.

For anyone looking to store and grow crypto assets, understanding ownership in cryptocurrencies is essential. Many newcomers start accumulating cryptocurrencies without grasping these fundamentals, exposing themselves to risks that could lead to loss of funds.

## How Ownership Works

Most cryptocurrencies operate on a blockchain specific to that currency, such as Bitcoin on the Bitcoin blockchain or Ether on the Ethereum blockchain. Owning cryptocurrency differs from holding traditional cash in your wallet.

> **In cryptocurrencies, ownership means possessing a special cryptographic key that allows you to spend a certain amount of cryptocurrency.**

So, when someone says they have 5 Bitcoins, it means they possess the cryptographic key to spend 5 Bitcoins.

When you send 1 Bitcoin to someone else, you use your cryptographic key to sign off 1 Bitcoin from your balance and transfer ownership to the recipient. After the transaction, only the recipient's cryptographic key can spend that 1 Bitcoin.

The key takeaway is that owning cryptocurrency means owning a cryptographic key.

A typical cryptographic key might look like this:

Losing or revealing this key means losing access to the cryptocurrency it controls. It's impossible for anyone, even the most powerful computer, to guess the key.

In the early days, people often lost their keys, leading to a significant amount of dormant Bitcoins. These Bitcoins are still on the blockchain, but the keys to access them are lost.

In practical terms, think of the private key as a secure alternative to traditional username and password authentication, but without recovery options if lost.

## Cryptocurrency Wallets

Cryptocurrency wallets are tools for holding and managing cryptographic keys.

> **Wallets do not physically store cryptocurrencies; they store cryptographic keys that control certain amounts of cryptocurrency.**

Genuine cryptocurrency wallets provide safe and private storage of these keys. However, not all wallets are genuine; many are pseudo wallets that do not give users true control over their assets.

The minimum requirement for any decent wallet should be full, unconditional ownership of the funds by the user.

### 1) Non-Custodial Wallets

Non-custodial wallets give users exclusive control over their funds. The wallet provider has no control over the assets.

Such wallets are the most secure form of cryptocurrency wallet because no third party can interfere with the funds. Users have exclusive control and full responsibility for their assets.

Non-custodial wallets keep their code open to the public for scrutiny.

> **Users of non-custodial wallets must understand that they have full control and responsibility over their crypto assets.**

This is the only type of wallet recommended for safe storage. Later sections will delve into the differences between various non-custodial wallets and the risks associated with them.

### 2) Custodial Wallets

Custodial wallets do not give users exclusive control over their funds. The wallet provider controls the funds and executes transactions on the userâ€™s behalf. Such wallets are the least secure because the provider has full control over access and funds.

> **Wallet providers can block users from accessing their wallets or freeze their funds.**
>
> **Unlike banks, wallet providers are not as regulated, posing significant risks for users holding large amounts of cryptocurrency.**

Custodial wallets are not private, as the provider can see the full transaction history. Cryptocurrency exchanges often provide custodial wallets, which are not advisable for long-term storage.

> **Funds on a custodial wallet are vulnerable to hacking or data breaches, as has happened in the past and will likely happen in the future.**

Providers could freeze funds, restrict usage, or block access without warning. Unfortunately, many popular wallets are custodial.

### 3) Hybrid Wallets

In hybrid wallets, neither the wallet owner nor the provider has full control. Both parties must approve transactions, providing protection against hacking but allowing for potential censorship by the provider.

Non-custodial wallets ensure that funds are indeed under your control and not dependent on any third party.
