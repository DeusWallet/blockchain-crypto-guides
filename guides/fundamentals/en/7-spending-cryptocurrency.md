# Spending Cryptocurrency

The ability to pay with Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies in stores remains uncommon. While some merchants are gradually starting to accept payments in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins, the vast majority of retailers have yet to adopt this payment method. However, there are several ways to spend your cryptocurrency, including using crypto debit cards.

## Crypto Debit Cards

Crypto debit cards can be used anywhere that accepts Visa and MasterCard. Here’s how they work:

1. **Payment**: You pay with the card just like a regular debit card. It can also be used to withdraw cash from an ATM.
2. **Conversion**: The payment amount is deducted from your crypto wallet balance at the current market rate.
3. **Fees and Rewards**: Depending on the card provider, there may be additional fees or perks like cashback rewards.

Some of the more popular providers of crypto debit cards, mostly available to residents of the US and Europe, include:

- [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/en/cards.html)
- [Coinbase.com](https://www.coinbase.com/card)
- [Cash.app](https://cash.app)

Note that all crypto debit card providers require some form of identification documents.

When using these services, the card provider will typically issue you a custodial cryptocurrency wallet that serves as the source of funds for your card.

> **Important:** The wallet provided by a debit card provider is custodial, so it’s best to avoid keeping large amounts of funds in it. Instead, use a non-custodial wallet for your primary funds and top up the wallet provided by the card provider with the amounts you plan to spend.
