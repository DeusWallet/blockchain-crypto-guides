# Bitcoin Cash Explained Simply

Bitcoin Cash, symbolized by BCH, is a cryptocurrency that originated from a fork of Bitcoin (BTC). A fork means it was created from the Bitcoin blockchain but has since developed into a distinct cryptocurrency with its own blockchain.

Bitcoin Cash was launched in August 2017. Although it shares the same foundational technology as Bitcoin, it operates as a separate entity with its own blockchain.

This guide will explain how Bitcoin Cash came into existence, its relationship with Bitcoin, and how it differs from the original Bitcoin.

> **Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) were originally the same cryptocurrency until they split in August 2017.**

Today, despite their similarities and shared name, Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash are different cryptocurrencies with unique blockchains and different market values.

Each cryptocurrency operates on its own decentralized network of servers, supported by its own community, engineering resources, and future vision.

Let's explore how Bitcoin Cash differs from Bitcoin. Since they share fundamentals, it's helpful to read the [Bitcoin guide](bitcoin.md) first.

## 1. Bitcoin Cash Origins

The Bitcoin blockchain can handle about half a million transactions per day.

>**Currently, the Bitcoin network processes around 5 transactions per second. On busy days, Bitcoin transactions may remain pending for hours, sometimes even days.**
>
> **In comparison, the Visa network processes about 1,700 transactions per second on average and can scale up to [24,000 transactions](https://usa.visa.com/run-your-business/small-business-tools/retail.html) per second.**

Bitcoin Cash emerged from the Bitcoin community's efforts to increase blockchain capacity. In 2017, disagreements about the best approach led to a split. The main debate centered around the maximum block size:

- One group wanted to increase the block size limit from 1 MB to 8 MB, allowing the blockchain to process up to 8 times more transactions per block.
- The other group opposed this, arguing for alternative scalability solutions, believing larger blocks were a temporary fix.

This division resulted in the creation of Bitcoin Cash, with proponents of larger blocks forming a new blockchain and cryptocurrency (BCH).

## 2. The Fork

In cryptocurrency, a 'fork' is when one blockchain splits into two, creating a new cryptocurrency. This process allows communities to diverge and follow different visions.

> **Anyone can fork a cryptocurrency, but without community support, it lacks the network necessary for survival and growth.**

In August 2017, supporters of larger block sizes forked Bitcoin, creating Bitcoin Cash. This group included major miners and influential early adopters.

> **The Bitcoin Cash fork demonstrated how open-source cryptocurrency projects can resolve ideological conflicts.**

Bitcoin Cash is a significant fork, impacting the community and technology. Here's how it happened:

- Both blockchains share transaction history until the fork date, August 1, 2017.
- Both have the same cryptocurrency cap of 21 million units.
- Users with Bitcoin in non-custodial wallets received an equivalent amount of Bitcoin Cash.

Since its inception, Bitcoin Cash has built a substantial community and continues to evolve.

## 3. BTC vs. BCH

Today, Bitcoin (BTC) is generally seen as the original cryptocurrency. However, there is debate over which is the 'true' Bitcoin as envisioned by Satoshi Nakamoto.

> **The Bitcoin Cash community views BCH as digital cash for everyday transactions, emphasizing low fees and quick settlements.**
>
> **Bitcoin (BTC) is seen as a store of value, focusing on security and privacy over speed. Efforts like the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network) aim to improve Bitcoin's transaction speed.**

**Bitcoin Cash (BCH)**:
- With larger blocks, Bitcoin Cash can handle up to 18 million transactions per day. However, it typically sees 30,000-40,000 transactions daily.
- Transaction fees are often below 1 cent, with faster settlement times.

**Bitcoin (BTC)**:
- Bitcoin processes about 300,000 transactions daily, near its capacity. Fees average around $1, with peaks up to $6.
- Bitcoin's larger network has more nodes, higher hash rate, and more active addresses, indicating a more extensive and secure network.

## 4. BCH Highlights

Bitcoin Cash offers several advantages:

- **Instant Confirmation**: BCH transactions are quickly finalized, making it suitable for everyday payments.
- **Low Transaction Fees**: Larger blocks and lower transaction volumes keep fees minimal.
- **Decentralized Storage**: BCH can serve as a censorship-resistant data storage layer for decentralized applications (DApps).
- **Smart Contracts**: BCH supports smart contract capabilities, though it's still developing in this area.

Both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash continue to evolve, driven by active communities.

## 5. Bitcoin Cash Price

Bitcoin Cash started trading at around $240 after the fork in August 2017, while Bitcoin was about $2,700. Since then, BCH's price has remained relatively stable, while BTC has ranged between $3,500 and $12,000.

The long-term value of a cryptocurrency reflects the growth of its network and community. While Bitcoin Cash has a significant social media presence, it lags behind Bitcoin and Ethereum. For BCH to overtake BTC, it must attract more demand.

## Summary

Bitcoin Cash, created from a fork of Bitcoin, offers an alternative with larger blocks, faster transactions, and lower fees. Despite its smaller network, BCH continues to evolve and has carved out a niche in the cryptocurrency landscape. Both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash serve different purposes and have distinct communities, contributing to the diversity of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.
