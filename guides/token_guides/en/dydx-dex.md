### 6. dYdX DEX

Most decentralized exchanges (DEX) enable investors to take long positions on various cryptocurrency assets. However, taking short, hedged, or more complex financial positions is currently challenging on many platforms.

dYdX is a decentralized exchange focused on short selling and derivatives, built on the Ethereum blockchain.

- Short positions enable investors to profit from price decreases and can be used for speculation or to hedge existing positions.

- Fully-collateralized, low-risk loans for short sellers allow token holders to earn interest fees.

- On dYdX, users can trade on margin with up to 10x leverage, using any supported collateral to back their positions.
