# Compound Explained Simply

[Compound](https://app.compound.finance) is a decentralized platform connecting cryptocurrency lenders and borrowers.

Here's how it works:

- **Lending**: Cryptocurrency owners deposit their assets into Compound's liquidity pool via smart contracts and earn interest.
  
- **Borrowing**: Borrowers request credit from Compound by providing collateral in another cryptocurrency.

Both lending and borrowing are accessible to regular users and smart contracts, allowing DeFi engineers to create services accessing liquidity in other DeFi platforms.

Compound supports 8 cryptocurrencies:

- [Wrapped BTC (WBTC)](https://compound.finance/markets/WBTC)
- [Ethereum (ETH)](https://compound.finance/markets/ETH)
- [USD Coin (USDC)](https://compound.finance/markets/USDC)
- [Tether (USDT)](https://compound.finance/markets/USDT)
- [Dai (DAI)](https://compound.finance/markets/DAI)
- [Augur (REP)](https://compound.finance/markets/REP)
- [0x (ZRX)](https://compound.finance/markets/ZRX)
- [Basic Attention Token (BAT)](https://compound.finance/markets/BAT)

Each cryptocurrency has specific borrowing and lending requirements, including interest rates and collateral factors.

- **Interest Rates**: Rates fluctuate based on market supply and demand for each cryptocurrency.
  
- **Collateral Factor**: Determines how much collateral is required to borrow. For instance, a 70% factor means users can borrow up to 70% of their collateral's value.

Users can view total lenders, borrowers, and available assets for borrowing on Compound's website.

## Borrowing on Compound

To borrow, users provide collateral in another cryptocurrency. The maximum amount they can borrow depends on the reserve factor for that collateral.

- **Fees**: Borrowing incurs interest fees based on market conditions.
  
- **Repayment**: Once repaid, borrowers can withdraw their collateral. However, if the borrowed balance exceeds the allowed amount, the account becomes insolvent and may be liquidated.

## Lending on Compound

Lenders can withdraw their assets (with interest) at any time. They receive cTokens in exchange, which represent their deposit and accrue interest over time.

- **cTokens**: These ERC20 tokens can be redeemed for their underlying assets. Interest accrues continuously, increasing the cToken's value over time.

## Compound Governance

Since May 2020, Compound has adopted community governance using its COMP token.

- **Proposal & Voting**: COMP holders can propose and vote on platform decisions, such as supported collateral assets and interest rates.
  
- **Token Distribution**: COMP tokens are distributed to active users supplying or borrowing cryptocurrencies, with 50% allocated to each group.

Compound aims to decentralize all platform aspects, with users earning COMP by participating in governance decisions.
