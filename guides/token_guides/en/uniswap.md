# Uniswap Explained Simply

[Uniswap](https://uniswap.info/home) is a decentralized, peer-to-peer cryptocurrency exchange for trading Ethereum and Ethereum-based tokens.

Uniswap is among the first [decentralized exchanges](../../defi/en/3-decentralized-exchanges.md) on Ethereum and has several key features:

- Uniswap’s smart contracts manage hundreds of millions of dollars in cryptocurrency autonomously and in a decentralized manner.
- It is considered one of the genuinely decentralized exchanges, meaning operators cannot censor users or shut down the service.
- It has the highest trading volume among decentralized exchanges, surpassing many centralized exchanges.
- Uniswap lists numerous cryptocurrency trading pairs and has a free token listing policy, allowing anyone to list any token and provide liquidity.
- It uses a simple mathematical formula and available tokens in its liquidity pool to determine asset prices and execute trades. More details can be found [here](https://uniswap.org/docs/v2/protocol-overview/how-uniswap-works) and [here](https://uniswap.org/docs/v2/core-concepts/swaps/).
- There are two versions, Uniswap V1 and the newer Uniswap V2. Following DeFi principles, earlier versions of Uniswap cannot be shut down.
- Uniswap V3 is being developed to further improve various elements of the exchange.

Today, Uniswap is one of the largest DEXes with [over $100 million](https://migrate.uniswap.info/home) in 24-hour trading volume.

## Trading on Uniswap

You can access Uniswap's trading interface through its public front-end at [uniswap.org](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap).

- There is a 0.03% service fee for executing transactions.
- It is generally cheaper to trade between Ethereum’s native ETH currency and Ethereum-based ERC20 tokens than between ERC20 tokens.
- Uniswap's smart contract design allows for lower Ethereum transaction fees compared to other decentralized exchanges.
- Traders may experience significant price slippage (deviation from market price) for larger orders.
- Trading pairs with more liquidity will provide better prices for larger orders than those with less liquidity.
- Large liquidity pools are essential for Uniswap to function well and allow large trades.

You can view all trading pairs on Uniswap and their respective liquidity pools [here](https://uniswap.info/pairs).

## Liquidity Providers

Uniswap was one of the first projects to introduce automated market making via liquidity pools.

- Each trading pair on Uniswap has its own liquidity pool, which anyone can create or join.
- To join a liquidity pool, users must deposit two tokens involved in the trading pair.
- Liquidity providers must deposit equal amounts of both tokens based on their current market prices.
- For example, the [ETHUSDT](https://uniswap.info/pair/0x0d4a11d5eeaac28ec3f61d100daf4d40471f1852) trading pair requires deposits of both ETH and USDT tokens.
- Liquidity providers earn a share of trading fees relative to the value of their deposited assets.
- Providers receive pool-specific tokens representing their share of assets in the pool.
- Liquidity providers can withdraw their assets and earnings at any time.

## Pool Profitability

While Uniswap liquidity pools may seem like a guaranteed way to earn passive income by putting idle cryptocurrency assets to work, there are risks:

> The cumulative value of deposited assets can decline despite earning trading fees.

To understand why a liquidity provider’s stake might decrease, despite income from fees, consider the formula governing Uniswap trading. This simple formula is explained [here](https://medium.com/@pintail/uniswap-a-good-deal-for-liquidity-providers-104c0b6816f2) along with factors to consider when evaluating liquidity pools.

A general rule of thumb for liquidity providers: any price change in deposited assets can reduce the value of the stake compared to just holding the original assets.

> Therefore, liquidity pools involving stable assets, such as stablecoins, are likely to perform better.

Since asset price changes play a crucial role in profit calculation, predicting future returns can be complex.

## Uniswap Token

In September 2020, Uniswap [introduced](https://uniswap.org/blog/uni/) its native governance token, UNI.

The primary use case for UNI is to participate in decision-making and other governance aspects, such as managing funds in the community treasury.
