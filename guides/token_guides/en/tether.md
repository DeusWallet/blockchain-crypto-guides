# Tether Explained Simply

Tether (symbol: USDT) is a cryptocurrency [stablecoin](../../defi/en/5-stablecoins.md) designed to mirror the value of the US dollar. It is the largest stablecoin in the cryptocurrency market, providing an easy way to maintain USD exposure.

Tether is widely available on most [cryptocurrency exchanges](../../fundamentals/en/6-buying-cryptocurrency-basics.md) and supported by many cryptocurrency wallets. It is typically traded in pairs with the highest daily trading volumes.

- The [BTCUSDT](https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT) pair on Binance often exceeds half a billion USD in daily trading volume.
- Tether's market capitalization has been steadily growing, surpassing [8 billion USD](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/) in May 2020.

While Tether tokens are issued on several blockchains, the majority are on the [Ethereum blockchain](ethereum.md). Over 5.5 billion USDT tokens have been issued via its [smart contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7) on Ethereum, which can be explored using tools like [Etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7).

## Tether Use Cases

Tether tokens are primarily used by cryptocurrency traders to avoid volatility by converting crypto holdings to Tether. Its high liquidity across many exchanges adds to its convenience.

For individuals, Tether allows anyone to store assets in a USD equivalent on exchanges or in [non-custodial wallets](../../fundamentals/en/2-wallets-basics.md) like Deus, without needing a bank account.

For cryptocurrency exchanges, Tether provides a way to facilitate crypto-to-fiat trading without relying on slow and heavily regulated legacy banking systems.

> **Sending 20,000 USDT from your wallet to your exchange account takes minutes compared to days if sent from a bank account.**

As an Ethereum token, Tether benefits from the pseudo-anonymity of Ethereum-based cryptocurrencies, allowing transactions without revealing the sender's identity. Anyone with a [crypto wallet](https://deuswallet.com) that supports Tether can send and receive these tokens.

Tether tokens can be purchased directly from the [Tether website](https://tether.to) or on [cryptocurrency exchanges](../../fundamentals/en/6-buying-cryptocurrency-basics.md) using fiat money (USD, EUR, etc.) or other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Similarly, Tether tokens can be redeemed for fiat currency by selling them on crypto exchanges or via the Tether website.

To buy Tether tokens directly from the website, a minimum deposit of 100,000 USD is required, and the same minimum applies when redeeming Tether tokens for fiat currency. Purchasing significant amounts of Tether from exchanges involves ID verification and KYC (Know Your Customer) checks.

## How Reliable Is Tether?

Tether (USDT) is a centralized stablecoin, requiring trust in the issuer, unlike decentralized stablecoins such as DAI.

In cryptocurrency, 'trustless' means that pre-programmed, unchangeable rules guarantee the system works without relying on any entity. Examples include [Bitcoin](bitcoin.md), [Ethereum](ethereum.md), or the [DAI stablecoin](makerdao.md).

### DAI vs. Tether

Both DAI and Tether are stablecoins, but DAI is decentralized. Learn more about [how DAI works](makerdao.md).

When holding DAI, users trust a pre-programmed code ensuring that DAI tokens are fully backed by collateral. DAI has the following properties:
- No entity can block someone from using DAI.
- No entity can freeze someone's DAI balance.
- No entity can misuse the collateral funds backing DAI.

These properties do not apply to Tether, which requires trust in Tether Limited.

> **Centralized stablecoins like Tether are supposed to have an equivalent amount of USD held by the issuing company.**

This ensures that Tether Limited can buy back all Tethers in circulation if needed.

> **In 2020 alone, Tether Limited issued billions of USDT, nearly doubling the tokens in circulation.**
>
> **If these new tokens are not properly backed, it poses a significant risk for Tether holders.**

Tether Limited claims all Tether tokens are 100% backed by cash and other liquid assets, but this has been a point of controversy.

### Other Risks

Beyond trust, other risks include:
- Tether Limited could go bankrupt, posing a risk for large Tether holders.
- The bank servicing Tether Limited could freeze its accounts, as happened in April 2017 when US Bank and Wells Fargo withdrew as banking partners.

Ultimately, the reliability of Tether depends on the trust in Tether Limited and external factors affecting its operations.
