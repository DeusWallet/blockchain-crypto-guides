### 4. Kyber DEX

[Kyber](https://kyberswap.com/) DEX, launched in 2017, raised approximately $50 million through its successful ICO sale of the KNC token, with Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin serving as an advisor.

For traders:

- Users looking to exchange Ethereum-based tokens can place limit orders, which execute trades at a price guaranteed to be higher or equal to a specified rate. This feature eliminates the need to constantly monitor the crypto market.

Highlights:

- Various DeFi service DApps integrate with Kyber for multiple purposes. For example, an app accepting payments in a cryptocurrency stablecoin can use Kyber to accept various cryptocurrencies and automatically convert them to the desired one.

- Kyber's native cryptocurrency token, KNC, serves as a governance token for KyberDAO. Currently, KNC tokens can be used for voting on important decisions. In the future, all aspects of the platform will be governed by KNC holders.
