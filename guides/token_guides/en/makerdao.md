# MakerDAO & DAI in Simple Terms

Let's begin with a brief introduction to Decentralized Finance, commonly known as DeFi.

[Bitcoin](bitcoin.md) was the pioneering blockchain, enabling decentralized finance by allowing anyone to send, receive, and hold Bitcoin without intermediaries like banks. However, Bitcoin's blockchain is limited to simple transfers between addresses.

Ethereum expanded on this by enabling conditional transfers, paving the way for programmable contracts on the blockchain. This innovation gave rise to Decentralized Finance (DeFi).

> **The Ethereum blockchain supports complex logic in transactions, enabling developers to create autonomous public services that operate without external interference. These services remain functional and accessible as long as the Ethereum blockchain is active.**

DeFi typically refers to financial services built on the Ethereum blockchain or similar platforms like EOSIO. Most major DeFi projects currently operate on Ethereum.

## 1. MakerDAO Overview

MakerDAO is one of the earliest DeFi projects on Ethereum.

It manages over half a billion USD through an automated set of rules (Smart Contracts) called the Maker Protocol.

> **A Smart Contract is a blockchain-based program that operates transparently and is typically immutable. Anyone can verify its functionality.**

MakerDAO, launched in 2014, is governed by a global, decentralized group of entities ranging from organizations to individuals.

> **MakerDAO provides a lending facility on Ethereum where users can borrow cryptocurrency for a small fee.**

Governance is conducted through voting by MKR token holders. The value of MKR tokens is driven by the public services offered by MakerDAO.

### 1.1 DAO Explained

A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is a project or organization with the following characteristics:

- Controlled by a distributed group of entities
- Governed through token ownership
- Operates on a public blockchain
- Transparent and verifiable operations
- No official physical presence

> **Unlike traditional corporations, DAOs operate based on pre-coded rules on the blockchain, without the possibility of interference.**

### 1.2 DAI As A Service

MakerDAO's primary product is the DAI stablecoin, which maintains a value close to 1 USD. MakerDAO’s services revolve around the DAI stablecoin.

> **A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency pegged to an external reference, typically USD, EUR, or Gold.**

Users can lock Ether as collateral to generate DAI. The collateral is returned upon loan repayment with fees.

- New DAI enters circulation when a loan is issued, backed by collateral worth 150% of the loan.
- Collateral is released when the loan and fees are repaid, and the returned DAI is destroyed.

The Maker Protocol ensures DAI maintains its peg to 1 USD through various mechanisms.

> **DAI is a trustless stablecoin, backed by verifiable collateral. Unlike centralized stablecoins like [Tether](tether.md), it doesn’t require trust in a central entity.**

### 1.3 MakerDAO Governance

MakerDAO is governed by MKR token holders through formal proposals and voting. Changes to the Maker Protocol are implemented only through this process.

MKR token holders benefit financially from the growth of MakerDAO, as demand for MKR tokens increases with usage of MakerDAO services.

> **MKR holders share the financial risks associated with DAI stability. Any issues with DAI stability directly impact the MKR token price, as new MKR tokens may need to be minted and sold to cover losses.**

There are currently over a million MKR tokens, with a market cap exceeding half a billion USD. MKR tokens are traded on cryptocurrency exchanges and can be stored in Ethereum-compatible wallets.

### 1.4 Key Players

MakerDAO includes entities like the Maker Foundation, which initially built the Maker Protocol and now collaborates with the community to achieve full decentralization. The Maker Foundation oversees certain organizational aspects, including governance and risk meetings.

The DAI Foundation manages MakerDAO’s key intangible assets, such as trademarks and code copyrights, based on strict statutes.

## 2. MakerDAO Services

MakerDAO’s core product is the DAI stablecoin, around which its public-facing services are built. These services include:

- Oasis: a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange
- Loan facilities via the Maker Protocol
- DAI savings with interest

### 2.1 Oasis Exchange

Oasis is a decentralized platform for exchanging Ethereum-based tokens, including DAI.

The platform operates entirely on the Ethereum blockchain, accessible through a [website](https://oasis.app) or directly via blockchain interactions. Users need a supported Ethereum wallet, like [Metamask](https://metamask.io), to deposit or withdraw funds.

### 2.2 Borrowing DAI

MakerDAO allows users to borrow DAI against collateral in Ether and other supported tokens like BAT, wBTC, and USDC.

- **Collateralization Ratio**: Typically requires 150% of the loan amount in collateral.
- **Vault Health**: Users must maintain the collateralization ratio to avoid liquidation.
- **Liquidation**: If the collateralization ratio falls below the required level, collateral is auctioned to cover the debt and penalties.
- **Stability Fee**: An annual fee paid to reclaim collateral, determined by MKR holders.

### 2.3 Lending DAI

Users can deposit DAI into the Maker Protocol and earn interest, known as the DAI Savings Rate (DSR). There are no limits or constraints on deposits or withdrawals.

The DSR is funded by stability fees collected from borrowers and is decided by MKR holders.

## 3. DAI Stability

MakerDAO maintains DAI's price stability through mechanisms controlling supply and demand.

### 3.1 DAI Price

MakerDAO adjusts the DAI Savings Rate and Stability Fees to influence the market price of DAI.

- **To increase DAI price**: Increase DSR or Stability Fees to boost demand or reduce supply.
- **To decrease DAI price**: Decrease DSR or Stability Fees to reduce demand or increase supply.

### 3.2 DAI vs MKR

The Maker Protocol ensures DAI is backed by sufficient collateral. In case of a significant drop in collateral value, new MKR tokens are minted and sold to cover shortfalls, incentivizing good governance by MKR holders.

> **MKR holders bear the financial risks of DAI stability, with potential dilution of MKR value in case of poor governance.**

### 3.3 The Maker (MKR) Price

The value of MKR tokens is tied to the governance and success of MakerDAO. Effective governance can increase MKR value, while poor governance may dilute it.

More usage of MakerDAO services increases demand for MKR tokens, potentially reducing supply through fee buybacks.

## Conclusion

MakerDAO is a leading DeFi project and a pioneer in DAO governance. It has demonstrated the viability of the DAO model, allowing anyone to participate in governance. Early investors in MakerDAO have seen significant returns, but future uncertainties and risks remain.

Overall, MakerDAO represents a successful experiment in decentralized finance and governance, with its innovative approach to lending, stablecoins, and community-driven decision-making.
