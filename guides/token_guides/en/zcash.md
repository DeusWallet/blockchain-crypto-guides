# Zcash Explained Simply

Zcash is a cryptocurrency similar to [Bitcoin](bitcoin.md), but it focuses heavily on privacy, using some of the most advanced cryptography in the industry.

This guide explains what makes Zcash unique, how to use it, and why it's growing.

## 1. Zcash Origins

Zcash originated from an experimental proposal by a group of scientists and mathematicians aiming to address Bitcoin's lack of privacy.

Launched on October 28, 2016, by [Electric Coin Co](https://electriccoin.co), Zcash was the first cryptocurrency to use [zk-SNARKs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/z/zksnark.asp) technology, also known as zero-knowledge proofs.

> In simple terms, a zk-SNARK allows one party to prove they possess certain information without revealing the actual information.

This enables the Zcash blockchain to verify transactions' validity (e.g., confirming the spender has enough funds) without exposing private data about the involved entities.

In contrast, every Bitcoin transaction reveals some information about the sender's balance and past/future transactions.

## 2. Zcash vs. Bitcoin

Compared to [Bitcoin](bitcoin.md) or [Ethereum](ethereum.md), Zcash offers enhanced privacy and allows fully confidential transactions.

Zcash users can choose to send private transactions based on the context and situation.

Aside from privacy, Zcash is a fork of Bitcoin and shares many fundamental properties, such as a limited supply of 21 million ZEC tokens.

> Like Bitcoin, Zcash transactions are publicly visible on a blockchain.
>
> However, Zcash users can choose to transact publicly or privately. Private transactions don't reveal any information about the involved parties or the amount transferred.
>
> Zcash nodes can validate private transactions without knowing the transaction details.

For compliance or audits (where transparency is required), Zcash offers a selective payment feature. [Selective disclosures](https://www.zfnd.org/zcon/0/workshop-notes/selective-disclosure-workshop/) allow users to share specific transaction details while keeping other information private.

Zcash highlights:

- Zcash's symbol is 'ZEC'. A single ZEC consists of 100 million sub-units called zatoshis, similar to Bitcoin's satoshis.
- While the Bitcoin blockchain takes about 10 minutes to process a block, Zcash processes blocks roughly every 75 seconds.
- Each processed block rewards miners with newly created ZEC. As of November 2020, the block reward is 3.125 ZEC.
- Like Bitcoin, the block reward halves approximately every four years until all 21 million ZEC are in circulation.

## 3. Zcash Privacy

Zcash has two types of addresses: transparent and shielded.

- Transparent addresses start with "t" and behave like Bitcoin addresses, exposing the sender, receiver, and transaction amount on the blockchain.
- Shielded addresses start with "z" and offer enhanced confidentiality.

These addresses are interoperable, allowing users to send and receive funds between different address types.

There are four Zcash transaction types:

- Fully shielded (z-to-z)
- Partially shielded (z-to-t)
- Partially shielded (t-to-z)
- Fully transparent (t-to-t)

Fully shielded transactions encrypt the sender, recipient, and amount, ensuring complete privacy. These transactions cannot be traced unless the sender or recipient reveals information.

Fully transparent transactions are similar to Bitcoin transactions, with visible addresses and transaction amounts on a public blockchain.

## 4. Zcash Ecosystem

Like all major cryptocurrency blockchains, Zcash is open-source, allowing anyone to explore its workings and reuse its codebase.

Zcash has grown a community of contributors, including world-class cryptographers, activists, and freedom fighters, due to its focus on privacy.

> Any global cryptocurrency project aiming for long-term survival needs a decentralized community willing to continue its development regardless of other entities.

While anyone can contribute to Zcash, the primary entities driving its growth include:

- **Electric Coin Company (ECC)**

    ECC created Zcash and supports its ongoing development through R&D, engineering, business development, and regulatory engagement. It was the first project to implement zero-knowledge proofs.

- **Zcash Foundation**

    A non-profit entity maintaining and improving the Zcash protocol for all users. Initially funded by donations from Zcash stakeholders, it now receives funding from the Community Development Fund.

    Website: [https://www.zfnd.org](https://www.zfnd.org)

- **Major Grant Review Committee (MGRC)**

    Initiated as part of the Canopy network upgrade, MGRC provides major grants to independent developers to further decentralize Zcash efforts.

These entities are fundamental to Zcash's growth, expansion, and further decentralization. Zcash is self-funded with strong community governance that aligns key stakeholders' incentives.

- From October 28, 2016, to November 18, 2020, 10% of all newly issued coins went to the “Founders’ Reward.”
- After November 18, about 20% of all newly issued ZEC (about 0.6 ZEC every 75 seconds) is distributed to the Community Development Fund, ending the Founders’ Reward.

The Community Development Fund supports new participants in improving, building upon, extending, and supporting Zcash.

## 5. Why Zcash is Growing

One major issue with existing cryptocurrencies is the lack of privacy. Despite popular belief, most cryptocurrencies offer little to no privacy.

Except for Zcash and a few others, most cryptocurrencies lack privacy, making them unsuitable for private transactions.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other major cryptocurrencies have not successfully addressed privacy concerns, often cited as their weakest point.

Privacy has become even more relevant as technology giants track internet activity, and central banks push for digital-only currencies.

Privacy-conscious cryptocurrency users and early adopters need privacy coins, and Zcash is one of the few that can provide this.

Its strong fundamentals and backing from some of the brightest minds in the cryptocurrency space attract many to Zcash.

## 6. Zcash Challenges

Like most cryptocurrencies, Zcash faces challenges that could hinder its growth.

- **Trusted Setup**

    Zcash's privacy technology relies on a 'trusted setup' to form initial parameters for private transactions. While safeguards are in place, critics suggest the founders could use this system to create unlimited Zcash tokens. Zcash's research team is working on [Halo](https://electriccoin.co/blog/explaining-halo-2/), which could eliminate the need for a trusted setup.

- **Shielded Adoption**

    The percentage of shielded transactions on the Zcash network is low compared to total usage. However, Zcash is making progress toward increasing shielded adoption, including support from major exchanges.

- **Blockchain Speed**

    While Zcash can process more transactions than Bitcoin, it is still limited to roughly 20 transactions per second. This is not an issue for now, as current activity is below the limit.

- **Competition**

    Competing cryptocurrencies like DASH and Monero also focus on privacy. While Monero currently has the highest market cap, it remains to be seen which will attract the most users in the long run.

From a user's perspective, we hope Zcash continues to grow and becomes the go-to privacy coin for those seeking compliance and on-demand privacy.
