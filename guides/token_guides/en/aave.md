# Aave in Simple Terms

[Aave](https://app.aave.com/) is a non-custodial, decentralized service on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to lend and borrow Ethereum-based cryptocurrency assets. Launched in January 2020, Aave has rapidly grown, attracting nearly $2 billion worth of cryptocurrency in just eight months.

## How Aave Works

- **Depositors**: Users provide liquidity by depositing their cryptocurrencies into decentralized lending pools, earning interest in return.
- **Borrowers**: Users can borrow from these lending pools by paying a fee.
- **Unique Feature**: Unlike other services like [Compound](../../token_guides/en/compound.md) or [MakerDAO](../../token_guides/en/makerdao.md), Aave allows borrowing without collateral.
- **Interest Rates**: Generally higher than those on other platforms.
- **Security**: Aave's smart contracts are non-custodial and decentralized, meaning the Aave team cannot access user funds.

Each asset has specific borrowing and lending requirements. Control over supported cryptocurrencies will eventually be transferred to Aave token holders.

## Lending on Aave

- **Earning Interest**: Lenders earn interest on deposited assets.
- **Security**: Deposits are secured by the collateral provided by borrowers.
- **aTokens**: Lenders receive aTokens, which earn interest and can be used to withdraw deposits along with earnings. aTokens are pegged 1:1 to the underlying asset.

## Borrowing on Aave

- **Collateral Requirements**: Borrowing requires collateral in the form of another cryptocurrency.
- **Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio**: Represents maximum borrowing power (e.g., 75% LTV means borrowing up to 75% of collateral value).
- **Interest Rates**: Borrowers can choose between fixed or variable rates.
- **Maintaining Collateral**: Borrowers must ensure collateral value remains above the minimum required to avoid liquidation.

## Flash Loans

Flash loans are unique to Aave, allowing users to borrow without collateral:

- **Mechanism**: Borrow assets within one transaction and return them before the transaction ends.
- **Fee**: A 0.09% fee is charged on flash loans.

Flash loans are primarily used by programmers for activities like arbitrage and refinancing.

## Aave Governance

Aave aims to become a fully community-governed decentralized autonomous organization (DAO):

- **AAVE Token**: Used for voting on protocol improvements and governance decisions.
- **Incentives**: AAVE token holders receive rewards and can participate in governance.
- **Emergency Fund**: Protects lenders' assets in case of unexpected events.
- **Deflationary Token**: A portion of fees is used to buy back and burn AAVE tokens.

## Introducing Aave 2.0

Aave 2.0, announced on August 14, 2020, introduces several new features:

- **Pay with Collateral**: Simplifies loan repayment transactions.
- **Fixed Rates**: Provides predictability in lending and borrowing rates.
- **Lower Transaction Costs**: Reduces costs for platform interactions.
- **Trading Features**: Allows users to trade debt positions and deposited assets across supported cryptocurrencies.

## Risks

As with any DeFi service, there are risks associated with smart contract bugs. Aave has had its contracts audited and offers a bug bounty program for community members to report vulnerabilities.
