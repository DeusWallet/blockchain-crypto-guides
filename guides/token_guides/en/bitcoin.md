# Bitcoin Explained Simply

Crypto newcomers have many questions:

- What is Bitcoin?
- How does it work?
- What makes it special?

This guide aims to answer those questions by introducing Bitcoin in simple, easy-to-understand terms.

## What Is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin, a digital currency, has been described in many ways over the years: from electronic cash to digital gold. It's increasingly seen as a wealth preservation tool like money, stocks, or precious metals. The idea of Bitcoin as an asset class is becoming more accepted.

Despite being around for over a decade, Bitcoin can still be complex and obscure for newcomers. Until 2014, storing Bitcoin was challenging for the average person. Although it has improved, there are still complexities.

Many new users initially see Bitcoin purely as a cryptocurrency, not realizing it's a decentralized platform capable of hosting a wide range of services.

## 1. Bitcoin Origins

The idea of Bitcoin was first proposed by [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto) in 2008. Satoshi outlined a network where value exchanges could happen without intermediaries.

> **The paper required an understanding of the monetary system and knowledge of mathematics, cryptography, and computer science.**

Satoshi proposed Bitcoin as a decentralized network with the following features:

- Not reliant on any single entity
- Functional and accessible 24/7
- Enforces equal rules for all participants
- Available to anyone unconditionally
- Censorship-resistant

This led to the creation of the Bitcoin blockchain. Initially, Bitcoin was worthless and known only to a few people. Over time, it evolved from being perceived as fun money for geeks to something that could challenge the financial system. Media played a significant role in shaping public perception, often negatively in the early years. Despite this, Bitcoin grew into a massive phenomenon powered by a large network of users.

## 2. Bitcoin Cryptocurrency

As explained in our [guide on blockchains](../../fundamentals/en/1-cryptocurrency-basics.md), a cryptocurrency is a unit of measure on a blockchain. The Bitcoin cryptocurrency, denoted by BTC, is the native unit on the Bitcoin blockchain.

Bitcoins are limited and scarce, with a maximum of 21 million. Here's how they are created and circulated:

- Since early 2009, the Bitcoin blockchain has been adding new Bitcoins to the network approximately every 10 minutes. So far, about 18.5 million Bitcoins have been released.
- New Bitcoins are awarded to one of the nodes on the network that successfully solves a mathematical problem, a process known as mining.
- The remaining three million Bitcoins will be created over the next 130 years through this process.
- The release of new Bitcoins is automated and regulated by algorithms coded into Bitcoin from the start.

It's estimated that about four million Bitcoins have been lost, typically because users lost their wallets without backups. Of the 18.5 million created so far, roughly 14 million are available for transactions.

## 3. Bitcoin As A Network

Often, Bitcoin is referred to as the cryptocurrency on the Bitcoin network.

> **However, Bitcoin is not just a cryptocurrency. It is a network and an open platform for commerce where value is denominated in Bitcoin (BTC) units.**

The Bitcoin network consists of various groups:

- Parties running Bitcoin node software
- Bitcoin mining facilities and pools
- People accumulating Bitcoin in wallets
- Anyone transacting in Bitcoin
- Engineers building services for Bitcoin

These groups drive the technology, adoption, and demand for Bitcoin.

> **The increase in Bitcoin's price is due to the growing number of people interested in it.**

Anyone can join the Bitcoin network and start transacting on equal terms. Most users participate by using wallets to send and receive payments. Some run Bitcoin nodes, which process and validate transactions and keep the full transaction history, known as the Bitcoin blockchain.

> **The Bitcoin blockchain is a chronological chain of blocks, each containing a batch of transactions.**
>
> **A new block is added to the Bitcoin blockchain approximately every 10 minutes.**

Nodes ensure only legitimate transactions are added to the blockchain, maintaining the network's openness, availability, decentralization, and security. There are at least [10,000 nodes](https://bitnodes.io) powering the Bitcoin network at any time. Setting up a node requires minimal effort and can run on an old computer.

- As long as one Bitcoin node is online, the network remains accessible.
- The more nodes there are, the harder it is for any entity to cheat.

There are two main types of nodes:

- **Full Nodes:** Keep a complete copy of the blockchain and independently verify any transaction.
- **Miner Nodes:** Compete to add the next block to the blockchain, with the first to solve a mathematical problem receiving the Bitcoin reward.

Running a miner node can be costly, often only profitable with specialized computers and industrial electricity rates.

## 4. Bitcoin Price

In the early years, the idea that Bitcoin would be worth thousands of dollars seemed outlandish. One early adopter famously spent 10,000 BTC (around $100,000,000 USD at current prices) on a pizza.

> **By June 2020, Bitcoin was consistently trading around $10,000. The biggest challenge was growing from $0 to $100.**

Bitcoin broke $1,000 in 2014 and reached an all-time high of $20,000 in 2017. Its price remains volatile, often swinging by more than five percent daily. The market cap needs to reach trillions before large transactions and market sentiment no longer significantly affect the price.

Today, Bitcoin is widely discussed in mainstream financial channels, with increasing attention from Wall Street and world leaders. Despite price fluctuations, engineers worldwide continuously improve Bitcoin technology.

In the cryptocurrency ecosystem, the most valuable is usually the one with the largest network and community. Some cryptocurrencies may be similar to Bitcoin but struggle to compete due to smaller networks.

## 5. Why Bitcoin Is Growing

Bitcoin's growth is driven by its potential to address major socioeconomic and geopolitical issues, not just as a new asset class.

> **Bitcoin is not only an improvement on financial transactions and wealth preservation; it's a new way to own and control assets.**

Unlike traditional financial instruments imposed by governments or central organizations, Bitcoin's core driving force is its global community.

Modern problems like money printing, currency debasements, and over-regulation drive people towards Bitcoin. The availability of cryptocurrency exchanges amid economic instability makes it easier for people to acquire Bitcoin.

## 6. Is Bitcoin Unstoppable?

Newcomers often doubt Bitcoin's ability to succeed, imagining a decentralized system replacing centralized financial institutions. However, governments would find it challenging to ban Bitcoin due to its decentralized nature.

> **The real question is: Can governments (or other organizations) stop Bitcoin?**

Even if a government tries to outlaw Bitcoin, enforcing such a ban is nearly impossible. As long as there's electricity powering computers and smart devices, the Bitcoin network can exist. Lawmakers can make participation difficult, but can't shut down the network completely.

The only way Bitcoin would lose value is if everyone stopped using it, which could only happen if an irreparable flaw in its code was discovered.

## 7. Bitcoin Challenges

Despite its growth, Bitcoin faces several challenges:

- **Bitcoin is slow:** The blockchain can't currently process more than half a million transactions per day. Solutions are being developed but are not yet widely adopted.
- **Bitcoin is complicated:** It remains complex for newcomers, creating a barrier to entry.
- **Lack of adoption:** Bitcoin is primarily used as a store of value or for speculative trading. More ways to spend Bitcoin are needed.
- **Lack of privacy:** Bitcoin is not fully private, making it unsuitable for illegal activities.

## 8. Bitcoin Forks

New users quickly learn about other cryptocurrencies. Some, like [Dash](https://www.dash.org), [Monero](https://www.getmonero.org), and [Zcash](https://z.cash), offer better privacy or scalability than Bitcoin.

Others, like [Bitcoin Cash](bitcoin-cash.md) and [Litecoin](https://litecoin-foundation.org), emerged from Bitcoin through forks. Forks are created when developers modify Bitcoin's open-source code and market it as a separate cryptocurrency. The most notable forks include Bitcoin Cash, which has gained significant market share.

> **The original Bitcoin, created by Nakamoto, has the ticker symbol BTC and is often referred to as Bitcoin Classic or Bitcoin Core.**

## 10. Address Formats

Bitcoin has three commonly-used address formats for receiving payments. Usually, the wallet app handles this automatically.

> **Your wallet app may support receiving funds only in one or all three formats.**

New address formats were introduced to make transactions smaller and increase network capacity.

- **Legacy

 Format:** The original format, starting with `1`
- **SegWit Format:** Introduced in 2017, starting with `3`
- **Bech32 Format:** Introduced in 2018, starting with `bc1`

Each new format is more efficient, but the previous formats remain valid and interoperable. All formats are accepted, but the newer ones offer better performance.

## Summary

Bitcoin, an innovative financial technology, continues to evolve and challenge traditional systems. With its decentralized nature, growing network, and potential to address major global issues, Bitcoin represents a new era in digital finance. While it faces challenges, its resilience and ongoing development suggest a promising future.
