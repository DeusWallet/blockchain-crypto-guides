## 5. Bancor DEX

[Bancor](https://www.bancor.network/) is a decentralized exchange similar to Uniswap, providing a platform for trading Ethereum-based tokens. Bancor features a native token called Bancor Network Token (BNT). While traders do not need to hold BNT, liquidity providers must hold BNT to create or contribute to a liquidity pool.

### Incentives for Liquidity Providers

- **Single-Token Liquidity Pools**: Bancor V2 allows liquidity providers to enter a pool with just one token, eliminating the need for a two-sided liquidity deposit.
- **Fee Accrual**: Liquidity pool tokens on Bancor accrue value by collecting trading fees, similar to other DEXes.
- **Additional Rewards**: In addition to trading fees, pool rewards can come from Bancor Protocol via BNT token inflation and from token projects through liquidity provider incentive programs.
- **Intermediary Token**: Every liquidity pool on Bancor holds BNT in its reserves along with the base token receiving liquidity. BNT acts as an intermediary, connecting pools within the network and across blockchains. For example, a trade from DAI to BAT follows the path: DAI > BNT > BAT.

### Security Incident

In July 2018, Bancor experienced a hack resulting in the loss of $23.5 million in crypto assets (ETH, NPXS, and BNT). The breach was due to a compromised wallet used for upgrading smart contracts. In response, Bancor temporarily shut down the exchange and froze the BNT, though it could not freeze the lost ETH and NPXS. This incident highlighted concerns about the true decentralization of the exchange. Charlie Lee, creator of Litecoin, criticized Bancor, stating that "An exchange is not decentralized if it can lose customer funds OR if it can freeze funds. Bancor can do both."
