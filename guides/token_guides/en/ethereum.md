# Ethereum in Simple Terms

Ethereum is frequently mentioned alongside Bitcoin as one of the most popular [decentralized cryptocurrencies](../../fundamentals/en/1-cryptocurrency-basics.md). 

Proposed in 2013 and launched in 2015, Ethereum was developed by [Vitalik Buterin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalik_Buterin) and several other contributors and co-founders, emerging six years after Bitcoin. 

Ethereum distinguishes itself from Bitcoin by offering a platform for decentralized services. While Bitcoin's blockchain facilitates value transfers using Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum enables the creation and operation of public services that are always online, unblockable, and operate exactly as advertised without intermediaries.

Think of Ethereum as a global computer open to everyone.

## 1. Why Ethereum

Unlike the regular web full of various services, websites, and applications, Ethereum is attractive because it is open and trustless:

- Anyone can use the Ethereum platform to host a decentralized service without needing permission. This could be an online store, a crowdfunding campaign, a game, etc.

- Services on Ethereum are permanent and accessible to anyone, anywhere in the world, as long as there is at least one Ethereum network server (node) online. You can check the number of [nodes online](https://ethernodes.org) at any given moment.

- Ethereum services are transparent. Anyone can verify that a service works as expected and review its full history.

- Operating an Ethereum node is open to anyone, making it extremely difficult to censor the network. Blocking a service on Ethereum is significantly harder than blocking a website.

Ethereum is well-suited for services where reliability and transparency are critical. For example, a lottery or voting app built on Ethereum cannot cheat. These apps are transparent and work exactly as programmed. Anyone with sufficient technical knowledge can check the underlying code and confirm there are no workarounds or vulnerabilities.

## 2. Ethereum Blockchain

Under the hood, Ethereum is a blockchain. If you're new to this concept, read our short [guide to blockchains](../../fundamentals/en/1-cryptocurrency-basics.md).

The Ethereum blockchain records all actions (transactions) that have ever happened on Ethereum. Transactions can range from simple Ether transfers to complex processes involving decentralized services (smart contracts).

Every transaction is broadcast to all Ethereum nodes within seconds. A consensus algorithm ensures all nodes have the same copy of the blockchain. Each node individually validates transactions, ensuring only legitimate ones are added.

- As long as at least one node is online, the Ethereum network remains operational.
- More nodes make the network more secure and resistant to censorship.

Ethereum nodes guarantee the network's openness, availability, decentralization, and security.

## 3. Ether Currency

Like Bitcoin, Ethereum has its own cryptocurrency called Ether (ETH), often referred to as Ethereum. A unit of Ether consists of smaller units called wei:

> **1 ETH = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 wei**

Ether is needed to pay fees for transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, giving it value and driving its [increasing value](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/).

Transaction fees are paid to Ethereum network nodes for:
- Transferring Ether
- Transferring Ethereum-based tokens
- Interacting with decentralized services

All fees go to network nodes, which anyone can operate from home. Unlike Bitcoin, the total supply of Ether is not capped. Instead, the annual supply of new Ether is limited to 18 million tokens.

## 4. Ethereum Is A Network

Terms like Ethereum network, Ethereum blockchain, and Ethereum platform refer to the global network of servers running Ethereum node software.

The Ethereum network consists of all servers worldwide running Ethereum node software. It is more than just a cryptocurrency; it is an open, decentralized platform for financial and other services where trust, transparency, and reliability are crucial.

Ethereum's extensive network attracts engineers and entrepreneurs interested in building services, not just the Ether currency.

## 5. Smart Contracts

A smart contract is a piece of code on a blockchain that enforces the terms of a contractual agreement. Essentially, a smart contract executes "when X happens, do Y."

Smart contracts are the foundation of every application or service on Ethereum. For example, a lottery on Ethereum consists of interconnected smart contracts.

A regular contract outlines the terms of an agreement, but a smart contract enforces them automatically on the blockchain.

Anyone with sufficient knowledge can write and add a smart contract to the Ethereum blockchain. Once created and agreed upon, the smart contract is broadcast to the network and stored permanently.

Smart contracts can hold significant balances and operate independently, fully managed by their underlying code.

## 6. Decentralized Applications

Decentralized Applications (DApps) are services built using smart contracts. A DApp may consist of one or more interconnected smart contracts.

DApps differ from regular centralized apps, which rely on a single entity or organization. Once deployed on the blockchain, a DApp operates without central control, preventing censorship, outages, and sudden changes.

Thousands of DApps currently reside on the Ethereum blockchain, often involving tokens used within their business logic. These tokens can be traded on public [cryptocurrency exchanges](../../fundamentals/en/6-buying-cryptocurrency-basics.md).

### Examples of Ethereum DApps:

- **MakerDAO**: A decentralized autonomous organization for lending, governed by MKR token holders. It issues loans in DAI stablecoin, pegged to the US dollar.

- **Uniswap**: A decentralized exchange allowing users to trade Ethereum-based tokens without intermediaries.

- **Exchange Tokens**: Tokens like Binance Coin (BNB) and Huobi Token (HT) offer benefits on their respective exchanges.

- **Stablecoins**: Cryptocurrencies like Tether (USDT) and USDC, pegged to USD, use Ethereum for transparency and liquidity.

## 7. DApps Ecosystem

Ethereum's versatility and native programming language, Solidity, attract engineers, entrepreneurs, and investors. Ethereum-based financial DApps handle [over 1 billion USD](https://cointelegraph.com/news/value-locked-in-crypto-defi-markets-hits-1-billion-milestone) in value.

## 8. Ethereum Problems

Despite its potential, Ethereum faces challenges:

- **Slow**: The Ethereum blockchain can process only a few million transactions per day. Efforts are underway to improve scalability.

- **Complicated**: Ethereum's complexity can be daunting for newcomers.

- **Lack of Privacy**: Ethereum is not private, and transaction details are publicly visible on the blockchain.

## 9. Ethereum Privacy

Ethereum's transparency allows anyone to see all transactions and balances for a given address. While Bitcoin addresses can change, providing some privacy, Ethereum addresses typically remain the same, posing a privacy risk.

Efforts are being made to improve Ethereum's privacy, but for now, transaction history and balances are openly available. 

When transacting with Ether, be aware that the other party can view your balance and transaction history. Although the identity behind an address is not immediately apparent, it is possible to link certain transactions to individuals with enough effort. If an exchange is hacked, user data could be compromised, revealing real-world identities connected to Ethereum addresses.
