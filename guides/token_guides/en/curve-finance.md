# Curve in Simple Terms

[Curve Finance](https://curve.fi) is a decentralized exchange similar to Uniswap, but it focuses specifically on trading stablecoins.

As DeFi grows, there's an increasing demand for stablecoin trading, and Curve meets this need. Stablecoins are highly sought after in the DeFi ecosystem, and Curve handles large trading volumes, often exceeding [50 million USD](https://www.curve.fi/dailystats).

## Curve Token

Curve aims to become a DAO and has a governance token, CRV, which provides [additional perks](https://guides.curve.fi/crv-launches-curve-dao-and-crv/) for users, including voting on important decisions.

Total supply: about 3 billion CRV

- 61% to liquidity providers
- 31% to shareholders
- 5% to burnable reserves
- 3% to employees

## Trading on Curve

- Curve's unique selling point is its trading algorithm, which offers better prices for large stablecoin trades.
  
- Compared to [Uniswap](../../token_guides/en/uniswap.md), Curve charges a slightly higher fee of 0.04% per trade.

## Liquidity Providers

Curve's liquidity pools are often more profitable than Uniswap's because they not only collect trading fees but also lend spare funds to external [DeFi lending](../../defi/en/4-lending-protocols.md) services, generating additional income.

- Currently, 4 out of 7 Curve liquidity pools earn income from trading fees and from lending to the [Compound](../../token_guides/en/compound.md) lending pool.

- Curve's pools allow liquidity providers to deposit just one stablecoin instead of all tokens in the pool.

- Providers can deposit a single asset to supply liquidity to multiple pools.

- Some pools offer bonuses to maintain balance. Depositing a low-share token earns a bonus, and withdrawing a predominant token also offers a bonus.

## Pool Profitability

- When depositing to a pool, your funds are automatically split into multiple tokens based on the pool's token distribution.

- For example, if you deposit 4 DAI into a pool with 200 DAI (50%), 100 USDT (25%), and 100 USDC (25%), your deposit is split into 2 DAI, 1 USDT, and 1 USDC.

- Withdrawals typically return all pool tokens, regardless of the deposit token.

- Due to the pool's versatile deposit mechanisms, adding funds can be expensive when the Ethereum network is busy.

## Risks

Curve Finance is more complex than Uniswap and integrates third-party DeFi services, increasing the potential for undiscovered issues in its smart contracts.
